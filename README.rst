Data science packages categorization
------------------------------------

This project aims at clustering Python Packages for Data Science under specific categories.

The initial list of Python packages for data science that are used for this experiment can be found 
in `hunders_datascience_packages <https://github.com/pacospace/data-science-lda/blob/master/datasets/hunders_datascience_packages.yaml>`__.
This preliminary list has been selected with collegues from AICoE and other departments at Red Hat.

Data gathering
==============

The steps used to create the initial dataset are descrbed in `README <https://github.com/pacospace/data-science-lda/blob/master/data_gathering/README.rst>`__.

Dataset cleaning and pre-processing
===================================

The steps used to create the initial dataset are descrbed in `README <https://github.com/pacospace/data-science-lda/blob/master/nlp/README.rst>`__.
