Issue the following command:\n\n::\n\n   python ./doc/scripts/docgen.py\n\nDocumentation is built into ``html/``\n\nThe PDF of the documentation can be found at ``html/theano.pdf``\n\n================\nDIRECTORY LAYOUT\n================\n\n``Theano`` (current directory) is the distribution directory.\n\n* ``Theano/theano`` contains the package\n* ``Theano/theano`` has several submodules:\n \n  * ``gof`` + ``compile`` are the core\n  * ``scalar`` depends upon core\n  * ``tensor`` depends upon ``scalar``\n  * ``sparse`` depends upon ``tensor``\n  * ``sandbox`` can depend on everything else\n\n* ``Theano/examples`` are copies of the example found on the wiki\n* ``Theano/benchmark`` and ``Theano/examples`` are in the distribution, but not in\n  the Python package\n* ``Theano/bin`` contains executable scripts that are copied to the bin folder\n  when the Python package is installed\n* Tests are distributed and are part of the package, i.e. fall in\n  the appropriate submodules\n* ``Theano/doc`` contains files and scripts used to generate the documentation\n* ``Theano/html`` is where the documentation will be generated\n"}}}
