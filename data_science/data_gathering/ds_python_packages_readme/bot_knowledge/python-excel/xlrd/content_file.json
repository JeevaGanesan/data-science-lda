You are advised to use [OpenPyXL](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) instead. If you absolutely have to read .xls files, then\nxlrd will probably still work for you, but please do not submit issues complaining that this library\nwill not read your corrupted or non-standard file. Just because Excel or some other piece of software opens your\nfile does not mean it is a valid xls file.\n\nFor more background to this: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/python-excel/P6TjJgFVjMI/g8d0eWxTBQAJ\n\n**Purpose**: Provide a library for developers to use to extract data from Microsoft Excel (tm) spreadsheet files. It is not an end-user tool.\n\n**Author**: John Machin\n\n**Licence**: BSD-style (see licences.py)\n\n**Versions of Python supported**: 2.7, 3.4+.\n\n**Outside scope**: xlrd will safely and reliably ignore any of these if present in the file:\n\n*   Charts, Macros, Pictures, any other embedded object. WARNING: currently this includes embedded worksheets.\n*   VBA modules\n*   Formulas (results of formula calculations are extracted, of course).\n*   Comments\n*   Hyperlinks\n*   Autofilters, advanced filters, pivot tables, conditional formatting, data validation\n*   Handling password-protected (encrypted) files.\n\n**Quick start**:\n\n```python\nimport xlrd\nbook = xlrd.open_workbook(\"myfile.xls\")\nprint(\"The number of worksheets is {0}\".format(book.nsheets))\nprint(\"Worksheet name(s): {0}\".format(book.sheet_names()))\nsh = book.sheet_by_index(0)\nprint(\"{0} {1} {2}\".format(sh.name, sh.nrows, sh.ncols))\nprint(\"Cell D30 is {0}\".format(sh.cell_value(rowx=29, colx=3)))\nfor rx in range(sh.nrows):\n    print(sh.row(rx))\n```\n\n**Another quick start**: This will show the first, second and last rows of each sheet in each file:\n\n    python PYDIR/scripts/runxlrd.py 3rows *blah*.xls\n\n**Acknowledgements**:\n\n*   This package started life as a translation from C into Python of parts of a utility called \"xlreader\" developed by David Giffin. \"This product includes software developed by David Giffin <david@giffin.org>.\"\n*   OpenOffice.org has truly excellent documentation of the Microsoft Excel file formats and Compound Document file format, authored by Daniel Rentz. See http://sc.openoffice.org\n*   U+5F20 U+654F: over a decade of inspiration, support, and interesting decoding opportunities.\n*   Ksenia Marasanova: sample Macintosh and non-Latin1 files, alpha testing\n*   Backporting to Python 2.1 was partially funded by Journyx - provider of timesheet and project accounting solutions (http://journyx.com/).\n*   Provision of formatting information in version 0.6.1 was funded by Simplistix Ltd (http://www.simplistix.co.uk/)\n"}}}
