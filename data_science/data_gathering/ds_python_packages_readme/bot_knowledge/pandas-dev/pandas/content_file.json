It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for\ndoing practical, **real world** data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has\nthe broader goal of becoming **the most powerful and flexible open source data\nanalysis / manipulation tool available in any language**. It is already well on\nits way towards this goal.\n\n## Main Features\nHere are just a few of the things that pandas does well:\n\n  - Easy handling of [**missing data**][missing-data] (represented as\n    `NaN`) in floating point as well as non-floating point data\n  - Size mutability: columns can be [**inserted and\n    deleted**][insertion-deletion] from DataFrame and higher dimensional\n    objects\n  - Automatic and explicit [**data alignment**][alignment]: objects can\n    be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply\n    ignore the labels and let `Series`, `DataFrame`, etc. automatically\n    align the data for you in computations\n  - Powerful, flexible [**group by**][groupby] functionality to perform\n    split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating\n    and transforming data\n  - Make it [**easy to convert**][conversion] ragged,\n    differently-indexed data in other Python and NumPy data structures\n    into DataFrame objects\n  - Intelligent label-based [**slicing**][slicing], [**fancy\n    indexing**][fancy-indexing], and [**subsetting**][subsetting] of\n    large data sets\n  - Intuitive [**merging**][merging] and [**joining**][joining] data\n    sets\n  - Flexible [**reshaping**][reshape] and [**pivoting**][pivot-table] of\n    data sets\n  - [**Hierarchical**][mi] labeling of axes (possible to have multiple\n    labels per tick)\n  - Robust IO tools for loading data from [**flat files**][flat-files]\n    (CSV and delimited), [**Excel files**][excel], [**databases**][db],\n    and saving/loading data from the ultrafast [**HDF5 format**][hdfstore]\n  - [**Time series**][timeseries]-specific functionality: date range\n    generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics,\n    date shifting and lagging.\n\n\n   [missing-data]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/missing_data.html#working-with-missing-data\n   [insertion-deletion]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/dsintro.html#column-selection-addition-deletion\n   [alignment]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/dsintro.html?highlight=alignment#intro-to-data-structures\n   [groupby]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/groupby.html#group-by-split-apply-combine\n   [conversion]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/dsintro.html#dataframe\n   [slicing]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#slicing-ranges\n   [fancy-indexing]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#advanced-indexing-with-ix\n   [subsetting]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#boolean-indexing\n   [merging]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/merging.html#database-style-dataframe-joining-merging\n   [joining]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/merging.html#joining-on-index\n   [reshape]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reshaping.html#reshaping-and-pivot-tables\n   [pivot-table]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reshaping.html#pivot-tables-and-cross-tabulations\n   [mi]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#hierarchical-indexing-multiindex\n   [flat-files]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/io.html#csv-text-files\n   [excel]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/io.html#excel-files\n   [db]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/io.html#sql-queries\n   [hdfstore]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/io.html#hdf5-pytables\n   [timeseries]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/timeseries.html#time-series-date-functionality\n\n## Where to get it\nThe source code is currently hosted on GitHub at:\nhttps://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas\n\nBinary installers for the latest released version are available at the [Python\npackage index](https://pypi.org/project/pandas) and on conda.\n\n```sh\n# conda\nconda install pandas\n```\n\n```sh\n# or PyPI\npip install pandas\n```\n\n## Dependencies\n- [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org)\n- [python-dateutil](https://labix.org/python-dateutil)\n- [pytz](https://pythonhosted.org/pytz)\n\nSee the [full installation instructions](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html#dependencies) for minimum supported versions of required, recommended and optional dependencies.\n\n## Installation from sources\nTo install pandas from source you need Cython in addition to the normal\ndependencies above. Cython can be installed from pypi:\n\n```sh\npip install cython\n```\n\nIn the `pandas` directory (same one where you found this file after\ncloning the git repo), execute:\n\n```sh\npython setup.py install\n```\n\nor for installing in [development mode](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_install.html#editable-installs):\n\n\n```sh\npython -m pip install -e . --no-build-isolation --no-use-pep517\n```\n\nIf you have `make`, you can also use `make develop` to run the same command.\n\nor alternatively\n\n```sh\npython setup.py develop\n```\n\nSee the full instructions for [installing from source](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html#installing-from-source).\n\n## License\n[BSD 3](LICENSE)\n\n## Documentation\nThe official documentation is hosted on PyData.org: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable\n\n## Background\nWork on ``pandas`` started at AQR (a quantitative hedge fund) in 2008 and\nhas been under active development since then.\n\n## Getting Help\n\nFor usage questions, the best place to go to is [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pandas).\nFurther, general questions and discussions can also take place on the [pydata mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/pydata).\n\n## Discussion and Development\nMost development discussion is taking place on github in this repo. Further, the [pandas-dev mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/pandas-dev) can also be used for specialized discussions or design issues, and a [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/pydata/pandas) is available for quick development related questions.\n\n## Contributing to pandas [![Open Source Helpers](https://www.codetriage.com/pandas-dev/pandas/badges/users.svg)](https://www.codetriage.com/pandas-dev/pandas)\n\nAll contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements and ideas are welcome.\n\nA detailed overview on how to contribute can be found in the **[contributing guide](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/development/contributing.html)**. There is also an [overview](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) on GitHub.\n\nIf you are simply looking to start working with the pandas codebase, navigate to the [GitHub \"issues\" tab](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues) and start looking through interesting issues. There are a number of issues listed under [Docs](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues?labels=Docs&sort=updated&state=open) and [good first issue](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues?labels=good+first+issue&sort=updated&state=open) where you could start out.\n\nYou can also triage issues which may include reproducing bug reports, or asking for vital information such as version numbers or reproduction instructions. If you would like to start triaging issues, one easy way to get started is to [subscribe to pandas on CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/pandas-dev/pandas).\n\nOr maybe through using pandas you have an idea of your own or are looking for something in the documentation and thinking \u2018this can be improved\u2019...you can do something about it!\n\nFeel free to ask questions on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/pydata) or on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/pydata/pandas).\n\nAs contributors and maintainers to this project, you are expected to abide by pandas' code of conduct.
