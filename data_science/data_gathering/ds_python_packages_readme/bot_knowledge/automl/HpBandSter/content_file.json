So you should be able to install it via:\n```\npip install hpbandster\n```\nIf you want to develop on the code you could install it via:\n\n```\npython3 setup.py develop --user\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe documentation is hosted on github pages: [https://automl.github.io/HpBandSter/](https://automl.github.io/HpBandSter/)\nIt contains a quickstart guide with worked out examples to get you started in different circumstances.\nCheck it out if you are interest in applying one of the implemented optimizers to your problem.\n\nWe have also written a [blogpost](https://www.automl.org/blog_bohb/) showcasing the results from our ICML paper.\n"}}}
