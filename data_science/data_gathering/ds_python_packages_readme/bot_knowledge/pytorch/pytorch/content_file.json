Useful for data loading and Hogwild training |\n| [**torch.utils**](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html) | DataLoader and other utility functions for convenience |\n\nUsually PyTorch is used either as:\n\n- a replacement for NumPy to use the power of GPUs.\n- a deep learning research platform that provides maximum flexibility and speed.\n\nElaborating further:\n\n### A GPU-Ready Tensor Library\n\nIf you use NumPy, then you have used Tensors (a.k.a. ndarray).\n\n![Tensor illustration](./docs/source/_static/img/tensor_illustration.png)\n\nPyTorch provides Tensors that can live either on the CPU or the GPU, and accelerates the\ncomputation by a huge amount.\n\nWe provide a wide variety of tensor routines to accelerate and fit your scientific computation needs\nsuch as slicing, indexing, math operations, linear algebra, reductions.\nAnd they are fast!\n\n### Dynamic Neural Networks: Tape-Based Autograd\n\nPyTorch has a unique way of building neural networks: using and replaying a tape recorder.\n\nMost frameworks such as TensorFlow, Theano, Caffe and CNTK have a static view of the world.\nOne has to build a neural network, and reuse the same structure again and again.\nChanging the way the network behaves means that one has to start from scratch.\n\nWith PyTorch, we use a technique called reverse-mode auto-differentiation, which allows you to\nchange the way your network behaves arbitrarily with zero lag or overhead. Our inspiration comes\nfrom several research papers on this topic, as well as current and past work such as\n[torch-autograd](https://github.com/twitter/torch-autograd),\n[autograd](https://github.com/HIPS/autograd),\n[Chainer](https://chainer.org), etc.\n\nWhile this technique is not unique to PyTorch, it's one of the fastest implementations of it to date.\nYou get the best of speed and flexibility for your crazy research.\n\n![Dynamic graph](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/docs/source/_static/img/dynamic_graph.gif)\n\n### Python First\n\nPyTorch is not a Python binding into a monolithic C++ framework.\nIt is built to be deeply integrated into Python.\nYou can use it naturally like you would use [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org/) / [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) / [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org) etc.\nYou can write your new neural network layers in Python itself, using your favorite libraries\nand use packages such as Cython and Numba.\nOur goal is to not reinvent the wheel where appropriate.\n\n### Imperative Experiences\n\nPyTorch is designed to be intuitive, linear in thought and easy to use.\nWhen you execute a line of code, it gets executed. There isn't an asynchronous view of the world.\nWhen you drop into a debugger, or receive error messages and stack traces, understanding them is straightforward.\nThe stack trace points to exactly where your code was defined.\nWe hope you never spend hours debugging your code because of bad stack traces or asynchronous and opaque execution engines.\n\n### Fast and Lean\n\nPyTorch has minimal framework overhead. We integrate acceleration libraries\nsuch as [Intel MKL](https://software.intel.com/mkl) and NVIDIA (cuDNN, NCCL) to maximize speed.\nAt the core, its CPU and GPU Tensor and neural network backends\n(TH, THC, THNN, THCUNN) are mature and have been tested for years.\n\nHence, PyTorch is quite fast \u2013 whether you run small or large neural networks.\n\nThe memory usage in PyTorch is extremely efficient compared to Torch or some of the alternatives.\nWe've written custom memory allocators for the GPU to make sure that\nyour deep learning models are maximally memory efficient.\nThis enables you to train bigger deep learning models than before.\n\n### Extensions Without Pain\n\nWriting new neural network modules, or interfacing with PyTorch's Tensor API was designed to be straightforward\nand with minimal abstractions.\n\nYou can write new neural network layers in Python using the torch API\n[or your favorite NumPy-based libraries such as SciPy](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/numpy_extensions_tutorial.html).\n\nIf you want to write your layers in C/C++, we provide a convenient extension API that is efficient and with minimal boilerplate.\nNo wrapper code needs to be written. You can see [a tutorial here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_extension.html) and [an example here](https://github.com/pytorch/extension-cpp).\n\n\n## Installation\n\n### Binaries\nCommands to install from binaries via Conda or pip wheels are on our website:\n[https://pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org)\n\n\n#### NVIDIA Jetson platforms\n\nPython wheels for NVIDIA's Jetson Nano, Jetson TX2, and Jetson AGX Xavier are available via the following URLs:\n\n- Stable binaries:\n  - Python 3.6: https://nvidia.box.com/v/torch-stable-cp36-jetson-jp42\n- Rolling weekly binaries:\n  - Python 3.6: https://nvidia.box.com/v/torch-weekly-cp36-jetson-jp42\n\nThey require JetPack 4.2 and above, and @dusty-nv maintains them\n\n\n### From Source\n\nIf you are installing from source, you will need a C++14 compiler. Also, we highly recommend installing an [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) environment.\nYou will get a high-quality BLAS library (MKL) and you get controlled dependency versions regardless of your Linux distro.\n\nOnce you have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) installed, here are the instructions.\n\nIf you want to compile with CUDA support, install\n- [NVIDIA CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) 9 or above\n- [NVIDIA cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) v7 or above\n\nIf you want to disable CUDA support, export environment variable `USE_CUDA=0`.\nOther potentially useful environment variables may be found in `setup.py`.\n\nIf you are building for NVIDIA's Jetson platforms (Jetson Nano, TX1, TX2, AGX Xavier), Instructions to [are available here](https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/1049071/jetson-nano/pytorch-for-jetson-nano/)\n\n\n#### Install Dependencies\n\nCommon\n```\nconda install numpy ninja pyyaml mkl mkl-include setuptools cmake cffi\n```\n\nOn Linux\n```bash\n# Add LAPACK support for the GPU if needed\nconda install -c pytorch magma-cuda90 # or [magma-cuda92 | magma-cuda100 | magma-cuda101 ] depending on your cuda version\n```\n\n#### Get the PyTorch Source\n```bash\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch\ncd pytorch\n# if you are updating an existing checkout\ngit submodule sync\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\n```\n\n#### Install PyTorch\nOn Linux\n```bash\nexport CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=${CONDA_PREFIX:-\"$(dirname $(which conda))/../\"}\npython setup.py install\n```\n\nOn macOS\n```bash\nexport CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=${CONDA_PREFIX:-\"$(dirname $(which conda))/../\"}\nMACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.9 CC=clang CXX=clang++ python setup.py install\n```\n\nEach CUDA version only supports one particular XCode version. The following combinations have been reported to work with PyTorch.\n\n| CUDA version | XCode version |\n| ------------ | ------------- |\n| 10.0         | XCode 9.4     |\n| 10.1         | XCode 10.1    |\n\n\nOn Windows\n\nAt least Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 (version 15.3.3 with the toolset 14.11) and [NVTX](https://docs.nvidia.com/gameworks/content/gameworkslibrary/nvtx/nvidia_tools_extension_library_nvtx.htm) are needed.\n\nIf the version of Visual Studio 2017 is higher than 15.4.5, installing of \"VC++ 2017 version 15.4 v14.11 toolset\" is strongly recommended.\n<br/> If the version of Visual Studio 2017 is lesser than 15.3.3, please update Visual Studio 2017 to the latest version along with installing \"VC++ 2017 version 15.4 v14.11 toolset\".\n<br/> There is no guarantee of the correct building with VC++ 2017 toolsets, others than version 15.4 v14.11.\n<br/> \"VC++ 2017 version 15.4 v14.11 toolset\" might be installed onto already installed Visual Studio 2017 by running its installation once again and checking the corresponding checkbox under \"Individual components\"/\"Compilers, build tools, and runtimes\".\n\nNVTX is a part of CUDA distributive, where it is called \"Nsight Compute\". To install it onto already installed CUDA run CUDA installation once again and check the corresponding checkbox.\nBe sure that CUDA with Nsight Compute is installed after Visual Studio 2017.\n\nCurrently VS 2017, VS 2019 and Ninja are supported as the generator of CMake. If `ninja.exe` is detected in `PATH`, then Ninja will be used as the default generator, otherwise it will use VS 2017.\n<br/> If Ninja is selected as the generator, the latest MSVC which is newer than VS 2015 (14.0) will get selected as the underlying toolchain if you have Python > 3.5, otherwise VS 2015 will be selected so you'll have to activate the environment. If you use CMake <= 3.14.2 and has VS 2019 installed, then even if you specify VS 2017 as the generator, VS 2019 will get selected as the generator.\n\nCUDA and MSVC have strong version dependencies, so even if you use VS 2017 / 2019, you will get build errors like `nvcc fatal : Host compiler targets unsupported OS`. For this kind of problem, please install the corresponding VS toolchain in the table below and then you can either specify the toolset during activation (recommended) or set `CUDAHOSTCXX` to override the cuda host compiler (not recommended if there are big version differences).\n\n| CUDA version | Newest supported VS version                             |\n| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 9.0 / 9.1    | Visual Studio 2017 Update 4 (15.4) (`_MSC_VER` <= 1911) |\n| 9.2          | Visual Studio 2017 Update 5 (15.5) (`_MSC_VER` <= 1912) |\n| 10.0         | Visual Studio 2017 (15.X) (`_MSC_VER` < 1920)           |\n| 10.1         | Visual Studio 2019 (16.X) (`_MSC_VER` < 1930)           |\n\n```cmd\ncmd\n\n:: [Optional] If you want to build with VS 2019 generator, please change the value in the next line to `Visual Studio 16 2019`.\n:: Note: This value is useless if Ninja is detected. However, you can force that by using `set USE_NINJA=OFF`.\nset CMAKE_GENERATOR=Visual Studio 15 2017\n\n:: Read the content in the previous section carefully before you proceed.\n:: [Optional] If you want to override the underlying toolset used by Ninja and Visual Studio with CUDA, please run the following script block.\n:: \"Visual Studio 2017 Developer Command Prompt\" will be run automatically.\n:: Make sure you have CMake >= 3.12 before you do this when you use the Visual Studio generator.\nset CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET_VERSION=14.11\nset DISTUTILS_USE_SDK=1\nfor /f \"usebackq tokens=*\" %i in (`\"%ProgramFiles(x86)%\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\Installer\\vswhere.exe\" -version [15^,16^) -products * -latest -property installationPath`) do call \"%i\\VC\\Auxiliary\\Build\\vcvarsall.bat\" x64 -vcvars_ver=%CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET_VERSION%\n\n:: [Optional] If you want to override the cuda host compiler\nset CUDAHOSTCXX=C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2017\\Enterprise\\VC\\Tools\\MSVC\\14.11.25503\\bin\\HostX64\\x64\\cl.exe\n\npython setup.py install\n\n```\n\n##### Adjust Build Options (Optional)\n\nYou can adjust the configuration of cmake variables optionally (without building first), by doing\nthe following. For example, adjusting the pre-detected directories for CuDNN or BLAS can be done\nwith such a step.\n\nOn Linux\n```bash\nexport CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=${CONDA_PREFIX:-\"$(dirname $(which conda))/../\"}\npython setup.py build --cmake-only\nccmake build  # or cmake-gui build\n```\n\nOn macOS\n```bash\nexport CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=${CONDA_PREFIX:-\"$(dirname $(which conda))/../\"}\nMACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.9 CC=clang CXX=clang++ python setup.py build --cmake-only\nccmake build  # or cmake-gui build\n```\n\n### Docker Image\n\n#### Using pre-built images\n\nYou can also pull a pre-built docker image from Docker Hub and run with docker v19.03+\n\n```bash\ndocker run --gpus all --rm -ti --ipc=host pytorch/pytorch:latest\n```\n\nPlease note that PyTorch uses shared memory to share data between processes, so if torch multiprocessing is used (e.g.\nfor multithreaded data loaders) the default shared memory segment size that container runs with is not enough, and you\nshould increase shared memory size either with `--ipc=host` or `--shm-size` command line options to `nvidia-docker run`.\n\n#### Building the image yourself\n\n**NOTE:** Must be built with a docker version > 18.06\n\nThe `Dockerfile` is supplied to build images with cuda support and cudnn v7.\nYou can pass `PYTHON_VERSION=x.y` make variable to specify which Python version is to be used by Miniconda, or leave it\nunset to use the default.\n```bash\nmake -f docker.Makefile\n# images are tagged as docker.io/${your_docker_username}/pytorch\n```\n\n### Building the Documentation\n\nTo build documentation in various formats, you will need [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org) and the\nreadthedocs theme.\n\n```\ncd docs/\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\nYou can then build the documentation by running ``make <format>`` from the\n``docs/`` folder. Run ``make`` to get a list of all available output formats.\n\n### Previous Versions\n\nInstallation instructions and binaries for previous PyTorch versions may be found\non [our website](https://pytorch.org/previous-versions).\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThree pointers to get you started:\n- [Tutorials: get you started with understanding and using PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/)\n- [Examples: easy to understand pytorch code across all domains](https://github.com/pytorch/examples)\n- [The API Reference](https://pytorch.org/docs/)\n\n## Communication\n* forums: discuss implementations, research, etc. https://discuss.pytorch.org\n* GitHub issues: bug reports, feature requests, install issues, RFCs, thoughts, etc.\n* Slack: The [PyTorch Slack](https://pytorch.slack.com/) hosts a primary audience of moderate to experienced PyTorch users and developers for general chat, online discussions, collaboration etc. If you are a beginner looking for help, the primary medium is [PyTorch Forums](https://discuss.pytorch.org).
