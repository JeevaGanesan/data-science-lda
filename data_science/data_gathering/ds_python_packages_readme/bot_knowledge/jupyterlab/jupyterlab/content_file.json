[Currently ready for users.](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyterlab-is-ready-for-users-5a6f039b8906)\n\n[JupyterLab](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is the next-generation user interface for [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) offering\nall the familiar building blocks of the classic Jupyter Notebook (notebook,\nterminal, text editor, file browser, rich outputs, etc.) in a flexible and\npowerful user interface.\nJupyterLab will eventually replace the classic Jupyter Notebook.\n\nJupyterLab can be extended using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) packages\nthat use our public APIs. To find JupyterLab extensions, search for the npm keyword [jupyterlab-extension](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:jupyterlab-extension) or the GitHub topic [jupyterlab-extension](https://github.com/topics/jupyterlab-extension). To learn more about extensions, see the [user documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/extensions.html).\n\nThe current JupyterLab releases are suitable for general\nusage, and the extension APIs will continue to\nevolve for JupyterLab extension developers.\n\nRead the latest version's documentation on [ReadTheDocs](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\n---\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Installation\n\nJupyterLab can be installed using `conda` or `pip`. For more detailed instructions, consult the [installation guide](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html).\n\nProject installation instructions from the git sources are available in the [contributor documentation](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n### conda\n\nIf you use `conda`, you can install it with:\n\n```shell\nconda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab\n```\n\n### pip\n\nIf you use `pip`, you can install it with:\n\n```shell\npip install jupyterlab\n```\n\nIf installing using `pip install --user`, you must add the user-level `bin` directory to your `PATH` environment variable in order to launch `jupyter lab`.\n\n#### Installing with Previous Versions of Jupyter Notebook\n\nWhen using a version of Jupyter Notebook earlier than 5.3, the following command must be run\nafter installation to enable the JupyterLab server extension:\n\n```bash\njupyter serverextension enable --py jupyterlab --sys-prefix\n```\n\n### Running\n\nStart up JupyterLab using:\n\n```bash\njupyter lab\n```\n\nJupyterLab will open automatically in the browser. See the [documentation](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/starting.html) for additional details.\n\n### Prerequisites and Supported Browsers\n\nJupyter notebook version 4.3 or later is required. To check the notebook version, run the command:\n\n```bash\njupyter notebook --version\n```\n\nThe latest versions of the following browsers are currently _known to work_:\n\n- Firefox\n- Chrome\n- Safari\n\nSee our [documentation](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/installation.html) for additional details.\n\n---\n\n## Development\n\n### Contributing\n\nTo contribute to the project, please read the [contributor documentation](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nJupyterLab follows the Jupyter [Community Guides](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community/content-community.html).\n\n### Extending JupyterLab\n\nTo start developing an extension, see the [developer documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/extension_dev.html) and the [API docs](http://jupyterlab.github.io/jupyterlab/index.html).\n\n### License\n\nJupyterLab uses a shared copyright model that enables all contributors to maintain the\ncopyright on their contributions. All code is licensed under the terms of the revised [BSD license](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/blob/master/LICENSE).\n\n### Team\n\nJupyterLab is part of [Project Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) and is developed by an open community. The maintenance team is assisted by a much larger group of contributors to JupyterLab and Project Jupyter as a whole.\n\nJupyterLab's current maintainers are listed in alphabetical order, with affiliation, and main areas of contribution:\n\n- Afshin Darian, Two Sigma (co-creator, application/high-level architecture,\n  prolific contributions throughout the code base).\n- Vidar T. Fauske, JPMorgan Chase (general development, extensions).\n- Tim George, Cal Poly (UI/UX design, strategy, management, user needs analysis)\n- Brian Granger, AWS (co-creator, strategy, vision, management, UI/UX design,\n  architecture).\n- Jason Grout, Bloomberg (co-creator, vision, general development).\n- Max Klein, JPMorgan Chase (UI Package, build system, general development, extensions).\n- Fernando Perez, UC Berkeley (co-creator, vision).\n- Ian Rose, Quansight/City of LA (general core development, extensions).\n- Saul Shanabrook, Quansight (general development, extensions)\n- Steven Silvester, AWS (co-creator, release management, packaging,\n  prolific contributions throughout the code base).\n\nMaintainer emeritus:\n\n- Chris Colbert, Project Jupyter (co-creator, application/low-level architecture,\n  technical leadership, vision, PhosphorJS)\n- Cameron Oelsen, Cal Poly (UI/UX design).\n- Jessica Forde, Project Jupyter (demo, documentation)\n\nThis list is provided to give the reader context on who we are and how our team functions.\nTo be listed, please submit a pull request with your information.\n\n---\n\n## Getting help\n\nWe encourage you to ask questions on the [Discourse forum](https://discourse.jupyter.org/c/jupyterlab). A question answered there can become a useful resource for others.\n\nPlease use the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues) to provide feedback or submit a bug report. To keep resolved issues self-contained, the [lock bot](https://github.com/apps/lock) will lock closed issues as resolved after a period of inactivity. If related discussion is still needed after an issue is locked, please open a new issue and reference the old issue.\n\n### Weekly Dev Meeting\n\nWe have videoconference meetings every week where we discuss what we have been working on and get feedback from one another.\n\nAnyone is welcome to attend, if they would like to discuss a topic or just to listen in.\n\n- When: Wednesdays [9AM Pacific Time](https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/?t=9%3A00%20am&tz=San%20Francisco&)\n- Where: [`jovyan` Zoom](https://zoom.us/my/jovyan)\n- What: [Meeting notes](https://hackmd.io/Uscrk0N1RhCtX-p6ZHUuWQ?both)\n"}}}
