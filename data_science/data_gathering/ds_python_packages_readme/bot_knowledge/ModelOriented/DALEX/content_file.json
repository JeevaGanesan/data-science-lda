Opaqueness leads to distrust. Distrust leads to ignoration. Ignoration leads to rejection.\n\nThe `DALEX` package xrays any model and helps to explore and explain its behaviour, helps to understand how complex models are working. The main function `explain()` creates a wrapper around a predictive model. Wrapped models may then be explored and compared with a collection of local and global explainers. Recent developents from the area of Interpretable Machine Learning/eXplainable Artificial Intelligence.\n\nThe philosophy behind `DALEX` explanations is described in the [Explanatory Model Analysis](https://pbiecek.github.io/ema/) e-book. The `DALEX` package is a part of [DrWhy.AI](http://DrWhy.AI) universe.\n\nIf you work with `scikitlearn`, `keras`, `H2O`, `mljar` or `mlr`, you may be interested in the [DALEXtra](https://github.com/ModelOriented/DALEXtra) package. It is an extension pack for `DALEX` with easy to use connectors to models created in these libraries.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"https://pbiecek.github.io/ema/introduction.html#bookstructure\"><img src=\"misc/DALEXpiramide.png\" width=\"800\"/></a>\n</p>\n\n\n## Installation\n\nThe easiest way to get the **R** version of DALEX is to install it from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=DALEX)\n\n```\ninstall.packages(\"DALEX\")\n```\n\nThe **Python** version of dalex is available on [pip](https://pypi.org/project/dalex/)\n\n```\npip install dalex\n```\n\n## Learn more\n\nMachine Learning models are widely used and have various applications in classification or regression tasks. Due to increasing computational power, availability of new data sources and new methods, ML models are more and more complex. Models created with techniques like boosting, bagging of neural networks are true black boxes. It is hard to trace the link between input variables and model outcomes. They are use because of high performance, but lack of interpretability is one of their weakest sides.\n\nIn many applications we need to know, understand or prove how input variables are used in the model and what impact do they have on final model prediction. `DALEX` is a set of tools that help to understand how complex models are working.\n\n## Cheatsheet\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"https://github.com/ModelOriented/DALEX/raw/master/misc/cheatsheet_local_explainers.png\"><img src=\"https://github.com/ModelOriented/DALEX/raw/master/misc/cheatsheet_local_explainers.png\" width=\"500\"/></a>\n</p>\n\n\n### DALEX show-cases\n\n* [XAI in the jungle of competing frameworks for machine learning](https://medium.com/@ModelOriented/xai-in-the-jungle-of-competing-frameworks-for-machine-learning-fa6e96a99644)\n* [Gentle introduction to DALEX with examples](https://pbiecek.github.io/DALEX_docs/) showt introduction to the `DALEX` package.\n* [How to compare models created in different languages](https://raw.githack.com/pbiecek/DALEX_docs/master/vignettes/Multilanguages_comparision.html) crosscomparison of gbm and CatBoost in R / gbm in h2o / gbm in python\n* [How to use DALEX for fraud detection](https://rawgit.com/pbiecek/DALEX_docs/master/vignettes/DALEXverse%20and%20fraud%20detection.html)\n* [How to use DALEX with keras](https://rawgit.com/pbiecek/DALEX_docs/master/vignettes/DALEX_and_keras.html)\n* [How to use DALEX with parsnip](https://raw.githack.com/pbiecek/DALEX_docs/master/vignettes/DALEX_parsnip.html)\n* [How to use DALEX with caret](https://raw.githack.com/pbiecek/DALEX_docs/master/vignettes/DALEX_caret.html)\n* [How to use DALEX with mlr](https://raw.githack.com/pbiecek/DALEX_docs/master/vignettes/DALEX_mlr.html)\n* [How to use DALEX with H2O](https://raw.githack.com/pbiecek/DALEX_docs/master/vignettes/DALEX_h2o.html)\n* [How to use DALEX with xgboost package](https://raw.githack.com/pbiecek/DALEX_docs/master/vignettes/DALEX_and_xgboost.html)\n* [How to use DALEX for teaching.

These laws impact discussion around [Ethics of AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence). Today\u2019s robots, like cleaning robots, robotic pets or autonomous cars are far from being conscious enough to be under Asimov\u2019s ethics.\n\nToday we are surrounded by complex predictive algorithms used for decision making. Machine learning models are used in health care, politics, education, judiciary and many other areas. Black box predictive models have far larger influence on our lives than physical robots. Yet, applications of such models are left unregulated despite many examples of their potential harmfulness. See *Weapons of Math Destruction* by Cathy O'Neil for an excellent overview of potential problems.\n\nIt's clear that we need to control algorithms that may affect us. Such control is in our civic rights. Here we propose three requirements that any predictive model should fulfill.\n\n-\t**Prediction's justifications**. For every prediction of a model one should be able to understand which variables affect the prediction and how strongly. Variable attribution to final prediction.\n-\t**Prediction's speculations**. For every prediction of a model one should be able to understand how the model prediction would change if input variables were changed. Hypothesizing about what-if scenarios.\n-\t**Prediction's validations** For every prediction of a model one should be able to verify how strong are evidences that confirm this particular prediction.\n\nThere are two ways to comply with these requirements.\nOne is to use only models that fulfill these conditions by design. White-box models like linear regression or decision trees. In many cases the price for transparency is lower performance.\nThe other way is to use approximated explainers \u2013 techniques that find only approximated answers, but work for any black box model. Here we present such techniques.\n\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nWork on this package was financially supported by the 'NCN Opus grant 2016/21/B/ST6/02176'.\n"}}}
