In this example, we present an example of a Voil\u00e0 application powered by the C++ Jupyter kernel [xeus-cling](https://github.com/QuantStack/xeus-cling), and the [xleaflet](https://github.com/QuantStack/xleaflet) project.\n\n![Voila cling](voila-cling.gif)\n\n## The Voil\u00e0 Gallery\n\nThe [Voil\u00e0 Gallery](https://voila-gallery.org) is a collection of live dashboards and applications built with Voil\u00e0 and Jupyter widgets.\n\nMost of the examples rely on widget libraries such as ipywidgets, ipyleaflet, ipyvolume, bqplot and ipympl, and showcase how to build complex web applications entirely based on notebooks.\n\nNew examples can be added to the gallery by following the steps listed in the [voila-gallery/gallery](https://github.com/voila-gallery/gallery) repository.\n\n## Development\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to know how to contribute and set up a development environment.\n\n## Related projects\n\nVoil\u00e0 depends on [nbconvert](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert) and\n[jupyter_server](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/).\n\n## License\n\nWe use a shared copyright model that enables all contributors to maintain the\ncopyright on their contributions.\n\nThis software is licensed under the BSD-3-Clause license.
