In 2015, Jupyter notebook was released as a part of\nThe Big Split\u2122 of the IPython codebase. IPython 3 was the last major monolithic\nrelease containing both language-agnostic code, such as the *IPython notebook*,\nand language specific code, such as the *IPython kernel for Python*. As\ncomputing spans across many languages, Project Jupyter will continue to develop the\nlanguage-agnostic **Jupyter notebook** in this repo and with the help of the\ncommunity develop language specific kernels which are found in their own\ndiscrete repos.\n[[The Big Split\u2122 announcement](https://blog.jupyter.org/the-big-split-9d7b88a031a7)]\n[[Jupyter Ascending blog post](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyter-ascending-1bf5b362d97e)]\n\n## Installation\nYou can find the installation documentation for the\n[Jupyter platform, on ReadTheDocs](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).\nThe documentation for advanced usage of Jupyter notebook can be found\n[here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\nFor a local installation, make sure you have\n[pip installed](https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing/) and run:\n\n    $ pip install notebook\n\n## Usage - Running Jupyter notebook\n\n### Running in a local installation\n\nLaunch with:\n\n    $ jupyter notebook\n\n### Running in a remote installation\n\nYou need some configuration before starting Jupyter notebook remotely. See [Running a notebook server](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/public_server.html).\n\n## Development Installation\n\nSee [`CONTRIBUTING.rst`](CONTRIBUTING.rst) for how to set up a local development installation.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you are interested in contributing to the project, see [`CONTRIBUTING.rst`](CONTRIBUTING.rst).\n\n## Resources\n- [Project Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org)\n- [Online Demo at jupyter.org/try](https://jupyter.org/try)\n- [Documentation for Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) [[PDF](https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/jupyter-notebook/latest/jupyter-notebook.pdf)]\n- [Korean Version of Installation](https://github.com/ChungJooHo/Jupyter_Kor_doc/)\n- [Documentation for Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) [[PDF](https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/jupyter/latest/jupyter.pdf)]\n- [Issues](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues)\n- [Technical support - Jupyter Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jupyter)\n"}}}
