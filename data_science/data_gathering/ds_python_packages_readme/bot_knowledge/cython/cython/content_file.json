Cython is based on\nPyrex, but supports more cutting edge functionality and\noptimizations.\n\nThe Cython language is very close to the Python language, but Cython\nadditionally supports calling C functions and declaring C types on variables\nand class attributes.  This allows the compiler to generate very efficient C\ncode from Cython code.\n\nThis makes Cython the ideal language for wrapping external C libraries, and\nfor fast C modules that speed up the execution of Python code.\n\n* Official website: https://cython.org/\n* Documentation: http://docs.cython.org/\n* Github repository: https://github.com/cython/cython\n* Wiki: https://github.com/cython/cython/wiki\n\nYou can **support the Cython project** via\n`Github Sponsors <https://github.com/users/scoder/sponsorship>`_ or\n`Tidelift <https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-cython>`_.\n\n\nInstallation:\n-------------\n\nIf you already have a C compiler, just do::\n\n   pip install Cython\n\notherwise, see `the installation page <http://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/quickstart/install.html>`_.\n\n\nLicense:\n--------\n\nThe original Pyrex program was licensed \"free of restrictions\" (see below).\nCython itself is licensed under the permissive **Apache License**.\n\nSee `LICENSE.txt <https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/LICENSE.txt>`_.\n\n\nContributing:\n-------------\n\nWant to contribute to the Cython project?\nHere is some `help to get you started <https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.rst>`_.\n\nWe are currently building the next great Cython edition:\n`Cython 3.0 <https://github.com/cython/cython/milestone/58>`_.\nYou can help us make the life of Python 3.x users easier.\n\n\nGet the full source history:\n----------------------------\n\nNote that Cython used to ship the full version control repository in its source\ndistribution, but no longer does so due to space constraints.  To get the\nfull source history from a downloaded source archive, make sure you have git\ninstalled, then step into the base directory of the Cython source distribution\nand type::\n\n    make repo\n\n\nThe following is from Pyrex:\n------------------------------------------------------\nThis is a development version of Pyrex, a language\nfor writing Python extension modules.\n\nFor more info, see:\n\n* Doc/About.html for a description of the language\n* INSTALL.txt    for installation instructions\n* USAGE.txt      for usage instructions\n* Demos          for usage examples\n\nComments, suggestions, bug reports, etc. are\nwelcome!\n\nCopyright stuff: Pyrex is free of restrictions.
