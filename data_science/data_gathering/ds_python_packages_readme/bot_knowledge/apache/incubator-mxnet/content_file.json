It is a collection of\n[blue prints and guidelines](https://mxnet.apache.org/api/architecture/overview) for building\ndeep learning systems, and interesting insights of DL systems for hackers.\n\nAsk Questions\n-------------\n* Please use [discuss.mxnet.io](https://discuss.mxnet.io/) for asking questions.\n* Please use [mxnet/issues](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues) for reporting bugs.\n* [Frequent Asked Questions](https://mxnet.apache.org/faq/faq.html)\n\nHow to Contribute\n-----------------\n* [Contribute to MXNet](https://mxnet.apache.org/community/contribute.html)\n\nWhat's New\n----------\n* [Version 1.6.0 Release](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/releases/tag/1.6.0) - MXNet 1.6.0 Release.\n* [Version 1.5.1 Release](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/releases/tag/1.5.1) - MXNet 1.5.1 Patch Release.\n* [Version 1.5.0 Release](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/releases/tag/1.5.0) - MXNet 1.5.0 Release.\n* [Version 1.4.1 Release](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/releases/tag/1.4.1) - MXNet 1.4.1 Patch Release.\n* [Version 1.4.0 Release](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/releases/tag/1.4.0) - MXNet 1.4.0 Release.\n* [Version 1.3.1 Release](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/releases/tag/1.3.1) - MXNet 1.3.1 Patch Release.\n* [Version 1.3.0 Release](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/releases/tag/1.3.0) - MXNet 1.3.0 Release.\n* [Version 1.2.0 Release](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/releases/tag/1.2.0) - MXNet 1.2.0 Release.\n* [Version 1.1.0 Release](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/releases/tag/1.1.0) - MXNet 1.1.0 Release.\n* [Version 1.0.0 Release](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/releases/tag/1.0.0) - MXNet 1.0.0 Release.\n* [Version 0.12.1 Release](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/releases/tag/0.12.1) - MXNet 0.12.1 Patch Release.\n* [Version 0.12.0 Release](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/releases/tag/0.12.0) - MXNet 0.12.0 Release.\n* [Version 0.11.0 Release](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/releases/tag/0.11.0) - MXNet 0.11.0 Release.\n* [Apache Incubator](http://incubator.apache.org/projects/mxnet.html) - We are now an Apache Incubator project.\n* [Version 0.10.0 Release](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/releases/tag/v0.10.0) - MXNet 0.10.0 Release.\n* [Version 0.9.3 Release](./docs/architecture/release_note_0_9.md) - First 0.9 official release.\n* [Version 0.9.1 Release (NNVM refactor)](./docs/architecture/release_note_0_9.md) - NNVM branch is merged into master now.
