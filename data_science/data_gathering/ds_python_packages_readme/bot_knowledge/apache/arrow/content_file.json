It contains a\nset of technologies that enable big data systems to process and move data fast.\n\nMajor components of the project include:\n\n - [The Arrow Columnar In-Memory Format](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/format)\n - [C++ libraries](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/cpp)\n - [C bindings using GLib](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/c_glib)\n - [C# .NET libraries](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/csharp)\n - [Gandiva](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/cpp/src/gandiva): an [LLVM](https://llvm.org)-based Arrow expression compiler, part of the C++ codebase\n - [Go libraries](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/go)\n - [Java libraries](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/java)\n - [JavaScript libraries](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/js)\n - [Plasma Object Store](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/cpp/src/plasma): a\n   shared-memory blob store, part of the C++ codebase\n - [Python libraries](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/python)\n - [R libraries](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/r)\n - [Ruby libraries](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/ruby)\n - [Rust libraries](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/rust)\n\nArrow is an [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org) project. Learn more at\n[arrow.apache.org](https://arrow.apache.org).\n\n## What's in the Arrow libraries?\n\nThe reference Arrow libraries contain a number of distinct software components:\n\n- Columnar vector and table-like containers (similar to data frames) supporting\n  flat or nested types\n- Fast, language agnostic metadata messaging layer (using Google's Flatbuffers\n  library)\n- Reference-counted off-heap buffer memory management, for zero-copy memory\n  sharing and handling memory-mapped files\n- IO interfaces to local and remote filesystems\n- Self-describing binary wire formats (streaming and batch/file-like) for\n  remote procedure calls (RPC) and\n  interprocess communication (IPC)\n- Integration tests for verifying binary compatibility between the\n  implementations (e.g. sending data from Java to C++)\n- Conversions to and from other in-memory data structures\n\n## How to Contribute\n\nPlease read our latest [project contribution guide][5].\n\n## Getting involved\n\nEven if you do not plan to contribute to Apache Arrow itself or Arrow\nintegrations in other projects, we'd be happy to have you involved:\n\n- Join the mailing list: send an email to\n  [dev-subscribe@arrow.apache.org][1]. Share your ideas and use cases for the\n  project.\n- [Follow our activity on JIRA][3]\n- [Learn the format][2]\n- Contribute code to one of the reference implementations\n\n[1]: mailto:dev-subscribe@arrow.apache.org\n[2]: https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/format\n[3]: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW\n[4]: https://github.com/apache/arrow\n[5]: https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/docs/source/developers/contributing.rst\n"}}}
