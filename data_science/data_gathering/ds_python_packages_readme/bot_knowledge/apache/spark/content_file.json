It provides\nhigh-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that\nsupports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a\nrich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,\nMLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,\nand Structured Streaming for stream processing.\n\n<https://spark.apache.org/>\n\n[![Jenkins Build](https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/spark-master-test-sbt-hadoop-2.7-hive-2.3/badge/icon)](https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/spark-master-test-sbt-hadoop-2.7-hive-2.3)\n[![AppVeyor Build](https://img.shields.io/appveyor/ci/ApacheSoftwareFoundation/spark/master.svg?style=plastic&logo=appveyor)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ApacheSoftwareFoundation/spark)\n[![PySpark Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/xml.svg?label=pyspark%20coverage&url=https%3A%2F%2Fspark-test.github.io%2Fpyspark-coverage-site&query=%2Fhtml%2Fbody%2Fdiv%5B1%5D%2Fdiv%2Fh1%2Fspan&colorB=brightgreen&style=plastic)](https://spark-test.github.io/pyspark-coverage-site)\n\n\n## Online Documentation\n\nYou can find the latest Spark documentation, including a programming\nguide, on the [project web page](https://spark.apache.org/documentation.html).\nThis README file only contains basic setup instructions.\n\n## Building Spark\n\nSpark is built using [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).\nTo build Spark and its example programs, run:\n\n    ./build/mvn -DskipTests clean package\n\n(You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.)\n\nMore detailed documentation is available from the project site, at\n[\"Building Spark\"](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/building-spark.html).\n\nFor general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see [\"Useful Developer Tools\"](https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html).\n\n## Interactive Scala Shell\n\nThe easiest way to start using Spark is through the Scala shell:\n\n    ./bin/spark-shell\n\nTry the following command, which should return 1,000,000,000:\n\n    scala> spark.range(1000 * 1000 * 1000).count()\n\n## Interactive Python Shell\n\nAlternatively, if you prefer Python, you can use the Python shell:\n\n    ./bin/pyspark\n\nAnd run the following command, which should also return 1,000,000,000:\n\n    >>> spark.range(1000 * 1000 * 1000).count()\n\n## Example Programs\n\nSpark also comes with several sample programs in the `examples` directory.\nTo run one of them, use `./bin/run-example <class> [params]`. For example:\n\n    ./bin/run-example SparkPi\n\nwill run the Pi example locally.\n\nYou can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit\nexamples to a cluster. This can be a mesos:// or spark:// URL,\n\"yarn\" to run on YARN, and \"local\" to run\nlocally with one thread, or \"local[N]\" to run locally with N threads. You\ncan also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`\npackage. For instance:\n\n    MASTER=spark://host:7077 ./bin/run-example SparkPi\n\nMany of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nTesting first requires [building Spark](#building-spark). Once Spark is built, tests\ncan be run using:\n\n    ./dev/run-tests\n\nPlease see the guidance on how to\n[run tests for a module, or individual tests](https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#individual-tests).\n\nThere is also a Kubernetes integration test, see resource-managers/kubernetes/integration-tests/README.md\n\n## A Note About Hadoop Versions\n\nSpark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported\nstorage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of\nHadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.\n\nPlease refer to the build documentation at\n[\"Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN\"](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/building-spark.html#specifying-the-hadoop-version-and-enabling-yarn)\nfor detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including\nbuilding for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.\n\n## Configuration\n\nPlease refer to the [Configuration Guide](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration.html)\nin the online documentation for an overview on how to configure Spark.\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease review the [Contribution to Spark guide](https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html)\nfor information on how to get started contributing to the project.\n"}}}
