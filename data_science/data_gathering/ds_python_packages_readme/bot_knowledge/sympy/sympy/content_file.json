Feel free\nto ask us anything there. We have a very welcoming and helpful community.\n\n\nDownload\n--------\n\nThe recommended installation method is through Anaconda,\nhttps://www.anaconda.com/download/\n\nYou can also get the latest version of SymPy from\nhttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/sympy/\n\nTo get the git version do\n\n::\n\n    $ git clone git://github.com/sympy/sympy.git\n\nFor other options (tarballs, debs, etc.), see\nhttps://docs.sympy.org/dev/install.html.\n\nDocumentation and Usage\n-----------------------\n\nFor in-depth instructions on installation and building the documentation, see\nthe `SymPy Documentation Style Guide\n<https://docs.sympy.org/dev/documentation-style-guide.html>`_.\n\nEverything is at:\n\nhttps://docs.sympy.org/\n\nYou can generate everything at the above site in your local copy of SymPy by::\n\n    $ cd doc\n    $ make html\n\nThen the docs will be in `_build/html`. If you don't want to read that, here\nis a short usage:\n\nFrom this directory, start Python and:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    >>> from sympy import Symbol, cos\n    >>> x = Symbol('x')\n    >>> e = 1/cos(x)\n    >>> print(e.series(x, 0, 10))\n    1 + x**2/2 + 5*x**4/24 + 61*x**6/720 + 277*x**8/8064 + O(x**10)\n\nSymPy also comes with a console that is a simple wrapper around the\nclassic python console (or IPython when available) that loads the\nSymPy namespace and executes some common commands for you.\n\nTo start it, issue::\n\n    $ bin/isympy\n\nfrom this directory, if SymPy is not installed or simply::\n\n    $ isympy\n\nif SymPy is installed.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nSymPy has a hard dependency on the `mpmath <http://mpmath.org/>`_\nlibrary (version >= 0.19).  You should install it first, please refer to\nthe mpmath installation guide:\n\nhttps://github.com/fredrik-johansson/mpmath#1-download--installation\n\nTo install SymPy using PyPI, run the following command::\n\n    $ pip install sympy\n\nTo install SymPy using Anaconda, run the following command::\n\n    $ conda install -c anaconda sympy\n\nTo install SymPy from GitHub source, first clone SymPy using ``git``::\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/sympy/sympy.git\n\nThen, in the ``sympy`` repository that you cloned, simply run::\n\n    $ python setup.py install\n\nSee https://docs.sympy.org/dev/install.html for more information.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nWe welcome contributions from anyone, even if you are new to open source. Please\nread our `Introduction to Contributing\n<https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/Introduction-to-contributing>`_ page and\nthe `SymPy Documentation Style Guide\n<https://docs.sympy.org/dev/documentation-style-guide.html>`_. If you are new\nand looking for some way to contribute, a good place to start is to look at the\nissues tagged `Easy to Fix\n<https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Easy+to+Fix%22>`_.\n\nPlease note that all participants in this project are expected to follow our\nCode of Conduct. By participating in this project you agree to abide by its\nterms. See `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md <CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>`_.\n\nTests\n-----\n\nTo execute all tests, run::\n\n    $./setup.py test\n\nin the current directory.\n\nFor the more fine-grained running of tests or doctests, use ``bin/test`` or\nrespectively ``bin/doctest``. The master branch is automatically tested by\nTravis CI.\n\nTo test pull requests, use `sympy-bot <https://github.com/sympy/sympy-bot>`_.\n\nRegenerate Experimental `\\LaTeX` Parser/Lexer\n---------------------------------------------\n\nThe parser and lexer generated with the `ANTLR4 <http://antlr4.org>`_ toolchain\nin `sympy/parsing/latex/_antlr` and checked into the repo. Presently, most\nusers should not need to regenerate these files, but if you plan to work on\nthis feature, you will need the `antlr4` command-line tool available. One way\nto get it is::\n\n    $ conda install -c conda-forge antlr=4.7\n\nAfter making changes to `sympy/parsing/latex/LaTeX.g4`, run::\n\n    $ ./setup.py antlr\n\nClean\n-----\n\nTo clean everything (thus getting the same tree as in the repository)::\n\n    $ ./setup.py clean\n\nYou can also clean things with git using::\n\n    $ git clean -Xdf\n\nwhich will clear everything ignored by ``.gitignore``, and::\n\n    $ git clean -df\n\nto clear all untracked files.  You can revert the most recent changes in git\nwith::\n\n    $ git reset --hard\n\nWARNING: The above commands will all clear changes you may have made, and you\nwill lose them forever. Be sure to check things with ``git status``, ``git\ndiff``, ``git clean -Xn`` and ``git clean -n`` before doing any of those.\n\nBugs\n----\n\nOur issue tracker is at https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues.  Please report\nany bugs that you find.  Or, even better, fork the repository on GitHub and\ncreate a pull request.  We welcome all changes, big or small, and we will help\nyou make the pull request if you are new to git (just ask on our mailing list\nor Gitter).\n\nBrief History\n-------------\n\nSymPy was started by Ond\u0159ej \u010cert\u00edk in 2005, he wrote some code during the\nsummer, then he wrote some more code during summer 2006. In February 2007,\nFabian Pedregosa joined the project and helped fixed many things, contributed\ndocumentation and made it alive again. 5 students (Mateusz Paprocki, Brian\nJorgensen, Jason Gedge, Robert Schwarz, and Chris Wu) improved SymPy incredibly\nduring summer 2007 as part of the Google Summer of Code. Pearu Peterson\njoined the development during the summer 2007 and he has made SymPy much more\ncompetitive by rewriting the core from scratch, that has made it from 10x to\n100x faster. Jurjen N.E. Bos has contributed pretty-printing and other patches.\nFredrik Johansson has written mpmath and contributed a lot of patches.\n\nSymPy has participated in every Google Summer of Code since 2007. You can see\nhttps://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki#google-summer-of-code for full details.\nEach year has improved SymPy by bounds. Most of SymPy's development has come\nfrom Google Summer of Code students.\n\nIn 2011, Ond\u0159ej \u010cert\u00edk stepped down as lead developer, with Aaron Meurer, who\nalso started as a Google Summer of Code student, taking his place. Ond\u0159ej\n\u010cert\u00edk is still active in the community but is too busy with work and family\nto play a lead development role.\n\nSince then, a lot more people have joined the development and some people have\nalso left. You can see the full list in doc/src/aboutus.rst, or online at:\n\nhttps://docs.sympy.org/dev/aboutus.html#sympy-development-team\n\nThe git history goes back to 2007 when development moved from svn to hg.  To\nsee the history before that point, look at https://github.com/sympy/sympy-old.\n\nYou can use git to see the biggest developers.  The command::\n\n     $ git shortlog -ns\n\nwill show each developer, sorted by commits to the project.  The command::\n\n     $ git shortlog -ns --since=\"1 year\"\n\nwill show the top developers from the last year.\n\nCitation\n--------\n\nTo cite SymPy in publications use\n\n    Meurer A, Smith CP, Paprocki M, \u010cert\u00edk O, Kirpichev SB, Rocklin M, Kumar A,\n    Ivanov S, Moore JK, Singh S, Rathnayake T, Vig S, Granger BE, Muller RP,\n    Bonazzi F, Gupta H, Vats S, Johansson F, Pedregosa F, Curry MJ, Terrel AR,\n    Rou\u010dka \u0160, Saboo A, Fernando I, Kulal S, Cimrman R, Scopatz A.
