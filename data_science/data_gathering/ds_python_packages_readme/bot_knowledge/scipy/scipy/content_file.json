It includes modules for statistics, optimization,\nintegration, linear algebra, Fourier transforms, signal and image processing,\nODE solvers, and more.\n\n- **Website:** https://www.scipy.org/\n- **Documentation:** https://docs.scipy.org/\n- **Mailing list:** https://scipy.org/scipylib/mailing-lists.html\n- **Source code:** https://github.com/scipy/scipy\n- **Bug reports:** https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues\n- **Code of Conduct:** https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/dev/conduct/code_of_conduct.html\n- **Report a security vulnerability:** https://tidelift.com/docs/security\n\nSciPy depends on NumPy, which provides convenient and fast\nN-dimensional array manipulation. SciPy is built to work with\nNumPy arrays, and provides many user-friendly and efficient numerical routines,\nsuch as routines for numerical integration and optimization. Together, they\nrun on all popular operating systems, are quick to install, and are free of\ncharge. NumPy and SciPy are easy to use, but powerful enough to be depended\nupon by some of the world's leading scientists and engineers. If you need to\nmanipulate numbers on a computer and display or publish the results, give\nSciPy a try!\n\nFor the installation instructions, see INSTALL.rst.txt_.\n\nWe appreciate and welcome contributions. If you would like to take part in\nSciPy development, take a look at the file CONTRIBUTING.rst_.\n\n\n.. _CONTRIBUTING.rst:  https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst\n.. _INSTALL.rst.txt:   https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/master/INSTALL.rst.txt\n"}}}
